    <p class="lead">
  We are a non-equity non-profit flying club with three well-maintained aircraft based at DuPage Airport in
  West Chicago. We are well recognized as offering the most affordable flying opportunities in the Chicagoland area.
  The club's goal is to provide safe and enjoyable flying at the best possible value while striving to create a
  supportive environment and to build a spirit of fellowship amongst aviation enthusiasts.

  The club was established in 1975 and is fully operated by the volunteer efforts of member pilots
  and officers which keeps our flying rates very economical, monthly dues low, and minimal joining fees.
  There are no surprise surcharges nor any extra assessments. All club members receive full insurance
  coverage. The aircraft fleet is equipped for IFR with navigational upgrades like GNS430, DME, GPS, and
  auto-pilot. Special emphasis is placed on aircraft safety and preventive maintenance.

  Keeping the flying club vibrant and exciting is a key to our success; Members greatly value
  participating in all the social aspects. Enjoy the embedded video collage produced by our club members.
  Besides regular meetings, safety seminars, newsletters, and planned special events, our enthusiastic
  club pilots are focused on organizing fly-outs, sharing flights, charity missions, sponsoring community
  programs, boyscout merit badges, and joint maintenance activities. Our experienced and knowledgeable
  flight instructors are committed to promoting club safety, pilot proficiency, and student training.

  If you are looking for a rewarding, fun, friendly, and affordable flying club experience with a community
  of great pilots, we would love to share our passion and joy of flying with you. We'd be glad to meet with
  you, take a discovery flight, show off our planes. See why so many student pilots, part-time pilots, and
  active pilots find us to be the most cost-effective flying option in the Chicagoland area. Please
  contact us at 630-690-6610 or send email to memberships.
